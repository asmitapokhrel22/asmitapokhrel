PROFILE IMAGE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
================================

To add your profile photo to the portfolio:

1. Save your profile photo as "profile.jpg" in the same folder as index.html
   (The folder: C:\Users\L E N O V O\OneDrive\Desktop\New folder)

2. Recommended image specifications:
   - File format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - Size: 400x400 pixels (square) for best results
   - File name: profile.jpg (exactly as shown)

3. The image will automatically be displayed in the hero section with:
   - Circular border
   - Rotating border animation
   - Floating tech icons around it

4. If your image is not square, it will be automatically cropped to fit
   (centered crop)

5. If the image doesn't appear, make sure:
   - The file name is exactly "profile.jpg" (case-sensitive on some systems)
   - The file is in the same folder as index.html
   - The file is not corrupted

Note: The portfolio is already set up to use your name "Asmita Pokharel" throughout the website.
